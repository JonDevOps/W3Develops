SUPPORT files work just like CONTRIBUTING files. They can live in your repository root, .github/, or docs/ folder, and will be displayed throughout GitHub such as above the new issue form.

Instead of describing how to contribute to the project like CONTRIBUTING files do, SUPPORT files can be used to direct users to dedicated support resources, such as community forums, FAQ documents, or corporate support channels.

You can create a SUPPORT file to let people know about ways to get help with your project.

To direct people to specific support resources, you can add a SUPPORT file to your repository's root, docs, or .github folder. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's SUPPORT file.

You can create default support resources for your organization.



Tip: To help people find your support guidelines, you can link to your SUPPORT file from other places in your repository, such as your README file.
